In order to use a mjml file it has to be converted into an HTML file.

## First install mjml from npm:
```
$ npm init -y && npm install mjml
```
## Then run this command to save the mjml file to an html file:
```
$ mjml -r index.mjml -o index.html
```
Now the HTML file is availiable. Just make sure to inline the css first.
